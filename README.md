## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was great for practicing layout and positioning. It took a while for me to get the arrows in the desktop version to stay aligned with the image in the about section without disrupting the whole layout.

It was also nice to figure out how to control the slideshow with keyboard presses. I usually dont use keyboard events with normal websites, so it was nice to have a reason to practice it again.
